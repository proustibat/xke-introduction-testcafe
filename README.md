You can run it in different way, browsers, headless mode or not, etc (read the doc):

```
testcafe chrome:headless e2e/*.js --app 'yarn serve:build'
testcafe remote e2e/*.js --app 'yarn serve:build' 
testcafe remote e2e/*.js --app 'yarn serve:build' --qr-code
...

```

## CircleCI

On each push, build and tests are running. See the dashboard [here](https://circleci.com/gh/proustibat/xke-introduction-testcafe).

## Deploy

It deploys the app with Surge on [xke-introduction-testcafe.surge.sh](https://xke-introduction-testcafe.surge.sh/). Note that you need to be logged. 
You can deploy it on another domain by changing /public/CNAME content.
